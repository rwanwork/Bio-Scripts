Bioinformatics Scripts
======================


Introduction
------------

These are general scripts that I am using across several projects.  Hopefully they can be of use to others as well.


Requirements
------------

|Software       |Version  |Required?  |Conda package |
|---------------|:-------:|:---------:|:-------------|
|perl           | v5.26.2 | Yes       |perl          |
|perl-appconfig | 1.71    | Yes       |perl-appconfig|

These scripts have been used within a Ubuntu operating system and, more recently, within a [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) environment.  Most of them (if not all) have been implemented in Perl.


Files and Directories
---------------------

After installation, the following directory structure should result:


    .
    ├── fastq                   Scripts for manipulating FASTQ files
    ├── gwas                    Scripts for manipulating GWAS data sets
    ├── LICENSE                 Copy of the GNU GPL license v3
    └── README.md               This file you are reading
    
    
Future Work
-----------

I have numerous scripts that I keep locally; they will be gradually migrated over to this repository if I think they are useful in the long run.
